# Skill Author

Create and edit Claude Code skills following best practices.

## Skill structure

Every skill lives in a directory with at least a `SKILL.md`:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md           # Required — frontmatter + instructions
├── reference.md       # Optional — detailed docs Claude loads on demand
├── examples.md        # Optional — usage examples
└── scripts/           # Optional — helper scripts
```

## SKILL.md format

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: What it does and when to use it. Include keywords users would say.
allowed-tools: Read, Edit, Write, Bash
---

Instructions here...
```

### Frontmatter fields

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | No | Lowercase, hyphens/numbers only, max 64 chars. Becomes `/slash-command`. Defaults to directory name. |
| `description` | Yes | What + when. Claude uses this for auto-invocation — include trigger keywords. |
| `argument-hint` | No | Autocomplete hint, e.g. `[issue-number]` |
| `disable-model-invocation` | No | `true` to prevent auto-invocation. Use for side effects (deploy, commit, send). |
| `user-invocable` | No | `false` to hide from `/` menu. Use for background knowledge. |
| `allowed-tools` | No | Tools allowed without permission prompt when skill is active. |
| `model` | No | Model override when skill is active. |
| `context` | No | `fork` to run in isolated subagent. |
| `agent` | No | Subagent type when `context: fork` (e.g. `Explore`, `Plan`). |

## Key rules

1. **SKILL.md under 100 lines** — keep it focused on decision logic and instructions
2. **Move reference material to supporting files** — link with `[name](file.md)` so Claude loads on demand
3. **Clear, keyword-rich description** — Claude matches user intent against this to auto-invoke
4. **Use `disable-model-invocation: true`** for anything with side effects (deploys, sends, commits, destructive actions)
5. **Use `user-invocable: false`** for background knowledge that isn't a command

## Dynamic content

- `$ARGUMENTS` — all arguments passed (e.g. `/skill-name foo bar` → `foo bar`)
- `$0`, `$1`, `$N` — specific argument by index
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` — directory containing SKILL.md (reference bundled scripts)
- `` !`command` `` — run shell command before content is sent to Claude (inject dynamic context)

Example:
```yaml
---
name: pr-summary
allowed-tools: Bash(gh *)
---

PR diff: !`gh pr diff`
Summarize this pull request.
```

## Dual-save workflow

For this repo, always save skills to both locations:
1. `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (live)
2. `claude-local/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (repo backup)
3. Commit the repo copy

## Now: execute

Create or edit the skill as requested. Follow the rules above. If the skill has substantial reference material, split it into SKILL.md + supporting files.
